				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_1' n='N001'/>Lesbian energy is the subject of my art.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_2' n='N002'/>I weave useful objects, bags, ponchos, saddle blan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_3' n='N003'/>kets, and more. These objects are strong and durable,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_4' n='N004'/>for I weave them with active lesbians in mind as cus¬
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_5' n='N005'/>tomers. I want to make the best for lesbians. It is this
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_6' n='N006'/>attitude which makes my work &quot;lesbian art.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_7' n='N007'/>In the physical realm, there is little to set my work
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_8' n='N008'/>apart from another’s weaving; it could be copied
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_9' n='N009'/>exactly. But my feelings and thoughts, as I work, also
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_10' n='N010'/>become part of my product, just as surely as the design
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_11' n='N011'/>and color and threads themselves. This non-physical
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_12' n='N012'/>aspect is like the lint between the fibers, inseparable
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_13' n='N013'/>from the final product and, hopefully, seen and felt by
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_14' n='N014'/>the viewer, user, and/or wearer. It is the part which
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_15' n='N015'/>cannot be copied.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_16' n='N016'/>Obviously, this is a hard proposition to prove, but I
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_17' n='N017'/>know from experience that it is true. Because 1, as a

				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_19' n='N019'/>about lesbians and lesbianism as 1 work, lesbians are
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_20' n='N020'/>drawn to my work. One told me she physically felt
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_21' n='N021'/>warm glows pass through her body when she put on a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_22' n='N022'/>poncho; some have told me they feel strong with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_23' n='N023'/>One woman referred to stripes in the shoulders of a

				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_25' n='N025'/>Also, as a lesbian-separatist, I sometimes am thinking

				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_1_2' n='N001'/>negative thoughts and feelings about men and some

				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_3_2' n='N003'/>often do not even notice my display. There is no mag¬
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_4_2' n='N004'/>netic energy to attract them. Not only are they not
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_5_1' n='N005'/>attracted, but sometimes they feel repelled by my work.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>This pleases me, because I feel very strongly that I only
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>want to sell to lesbians, and this way I don’t have to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>make any special effort to accomplish it.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_9_1' n='N009'/>My partner is a jeweler, and she has noticed the same
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_10_1' n='N010'/>phenomenon. Many lesbians have told her that they
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>draw strength and self-esteem from her work, not only
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_12_1' n='N012'/>from the lesbian symbol rings and pendants, but also
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>from stone rings that are not specifically “lesbian.&quot; It is
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>the love for herself as a lesbian, and her concern for all
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>lesbians, which they are absorbing.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>Any subject, then, may be lesbian art, and lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>subjects may not be lesbian art. What makes the dif¬
				<lb facs='#facs_41_region_1674939977747_810_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>ference, in my mind, is the thought and feeling about

				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_43' n='N043'/>moment of realization.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_44' n='N044'/>I remember that for a long time, as a little girl, my
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_45' n='N045'/>fantasy was that I would marry a struggling artist and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_46' n='N046'/>definitely never be one. I have been feeling a connection
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_47' n='N047'/>between deciding to be a lesbian and taking control of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_48' n='N048'/>that fantasy and throwing it out the window for good. If

				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_53' n='N053'/>I idealized and romanticized struggling, and it is also
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_54' n='N054'/>part of the artist myth. Chronologically I decided to
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_55' n='N055'/>become an artist before I decided to become a lesbian,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_56' n='N056'/>but they are and were part of the same process; of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_57' n='N057'/>saying that my life is important, of valuing my life and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_58' n='N058'/>my self as a woman, of beginning to let go of living for
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_59' n='N059'/>others and seeing myself in the eyes of others and also
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_60' n='N060'/>giving up that deeply ingrained and conditioned

				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_1_1' n='N001'/>from inside of me, saying who I was and what the world
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_2_1' n='N002'/>was to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_3_1' n='N003'/>I remember when I was pretty young, in Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_4_1' n='N004'/>school, doing a drawing of the Tower of Babel, which
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_5_1' n='N005'/>was hung up with other drawings and my teacher said
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_6_1' n='N006'/>that I was a good artist. She said it on my Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_7_1' n='N007'/>school report card. That is the only memory I have of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_8_1' n='N008'/>being appreciated for art work. The next thing I
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_9_1' n='N009'/>remember is being in first grade and having our teacher
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_10_1' n='N010'/>put on music and we were supposed to draw to the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>music with our eyes closed. Everyone else in the class
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_12_1' n='N012'/>drew abstract drawings, apparently to the feeling and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_13_1' n='N013'/>rhythm of the music. I drew a house, a tree and a walk. I
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_14_1' n='N014'/>did not get a star for my drawing and I think I was—I
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_15_1' n='N015'/>must have been—very embarrassed. 1 remember in third
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_16_1' n='N016'/>grade all of us making towels where we stitched threads
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_17_1' n='N017'/>into the towels and I was the only one who did not make
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>a geometric design. I did some seagulls and an ocean
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>with a boat on it.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>I knew that an artist was the one thing I would never
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>be! There was something about my absolute non-identi¬

				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_23_1' n='N023'/>had significance beyond the fact that I wasn’t calling
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_24_1' n='N024'/>myself an artist.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_25_1' n='N025'/>I am seeing that being a lesbian means valuing my
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_26_1' n='N026'/>perceptions, as well as other women’s perceptions and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_27_1' n='N027'/>seeing that the world is a place 1 (we) have a right to be
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_28_1' n='N028'/>in charge of. I realize my outsideness and with that
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_29_1' n='N029'/>knowledge I begin to learn and then create beyond the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_30_1' n='N030'/>given reality, and live beyond it.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_31_1' n='N031'/>There is a kind of question that is thought-provoking
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_32_1' n='N032'/>and &quot;interesting&quot; that I feel very involved in thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_33_1' n='N033'/>about and asking. It has to do with some awarenesses
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_34_1' n='N034'/>that I have come to through being alive, particularly in
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_35_1' n='N035'/>the past few years. These questions stay with me and l
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_36_1' n='N036'/>love them and they feel like my “art. They are the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_37_1' n='N037'/>results of awakening parts of me that have been shut
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_38_1' n='N038'/>down, not allowed to grow. I catch a glimmer of the me

				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_40_1' n='N040'/>creative, awake and aware and active and unafraid. The
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_41_1' n='N041'/>feeling of a &quot;first time” or a &quot;new discovery” has to do
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_42_1' n='N042'/>with breaking through from that old space of hurt and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_43_1' n='N043'/>shut down to the way 1 can be, the way every person

				<lb facs='#facs_43_region_1674940016013_828_tl_49_1' n='N049'/>It has to do with owning parts of me, with feeling them,

				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_3' n='N003'/>phenomena of our times. Do you remember screaming

				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_11_1' n='N011'/>warrior strength. I know this sounds philosophical, and

				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_18_1' n='N018'/>laughed in the faces of the Mafia men. Our play with
				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_19_1' n='N019'/>language seems to come from the same impulse—to turn
				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_20_1' n='N020'/>around the givens, to reinforce each other’s daring and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_21_1' n='N021'/>strength in playing above this world. I think our humor,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_22_1' n='N022'/>like many other parts of our culture, is celebration—the

				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_24_1' n='N024'/>presence of each other, to drop the sticks of this world

				<lb facs='#facs_44_region_1674940045436_837_tl_27_1' n='N027'/>think our writers have mostly known this: they played

				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_7' n='N007'/>a lesbian was continuous with my development as a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_8' n='N008'/>feminist. I can’t talk about myself as &quot;lesbian artist

				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_15' n='N015'/>says, &quot;Being a lesbian meant 1 could create what
				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_16' n='N016'/>wanted.&quot; Yes. It meant I stopped caring about male

				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_22' n='N022'/>write. It was also the conscious creation/discovery of a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_23' n='N023'/>tradition of female art, a sense of connection with other
				<lb facs='#facs_45_region_1674940064280_846_tl_24' n='N024'/>creators, past and present, a connection which provides

				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_41' n='N041'/>kind of strength that isn’t real. (For instance, I find hero¬
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_42' n='N042'/>ines like Wonder Woman or Super Dyke offensive.) In

				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_44' n='N044'/>out at the most disadvantage, supposedly, was one of

				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_46' n='N046'/>who experienced herself in pain and out of joint with
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_47' n='N047'/>other people and the world. Over time, she is the charac-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_48' n='N048'/>ter who developed the most strength. The other women
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_49' n='N049'/>in the book, who initially were more appealing, did not
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_50' n='N050'/>grow as much. It surprised me during the writing of the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_51' n='N051'/>book, to see this woman, the most ineffectual and hurt¬

				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_53' n='N053'/>human being there. I didn’t intend for this to happen;
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_54' n='N054'/>she just grew naturally within the events and feelings
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_55' n='N055'/>and interactions of the novel. And looking back, I think
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_56' n='N056'/>her depth came from her being so connected to, so
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_57' n='N057'/>aware of, her pain. So when I present images of wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_51_region_1674940185213_903_tl_58' n='N058'/>en’s strength, 1 want that to come out of a true under¬
