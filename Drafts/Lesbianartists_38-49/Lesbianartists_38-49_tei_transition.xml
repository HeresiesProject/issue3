				We are a collective of lesbian artists working
				on a lesbian issue of Heresies: A Feminist Pub-
				lication on Art &amp; Politics. We are soliciting 
				material of all kinds, but in particular we are
				asking for responses to this question:
				What does being a lesbian artist mean to you?
				(Your work, your medium, your relationships to
				other artists, to the Art World, to the Lesbian
				community, etc.)
				You can approach the question verbally and/or
				visually, in any way that seems most applicable 
				to you. In the issue we will print the question
				along with the replies. If you have any spec-
				ific feelings, pro or con, about signing your
				name, please include them in your response.
				Our copy deadline is April 15. Please send all
				material to: HERESIES, Box 766, Canal Street
				Station, New York, N.Y. 10013. C/O 3rd Issue.
				We will be selecting the material for the issue
				and contacting you in the spring. If YOU consider
				yourself to be a lesbian artist, please respond.
				And thank you.

				Lesbian energy is the subject of my art.
				I weave useful objects, bags, ponchos, saddle blan¬
				kets, and more. These objects are strong and durable,
				for I weave them with active lesbians in mind as cus¬
				tomers. I want to make the best for lesbians. It is this
				attitude which makes my work "lesbian art.
				In the physical realm, there is little to set my work
				apart from another’s weaving; it could be copied
				exactly. But my feelings and thoughts, as I work, also
				become part of my product, just as surely as the design
				and color and threads themselves. This non-physical
				aspect is like the lint between the fibers, inseparable
				from the final product and, hopefully, seen and felt by
				the viewer, user, and/or wearer. It is the part which
				cannot be copied.
				Obviously, this is a hard proposition to prove, but I
				know from experience that it is true. Because 1, as a
				lesbian-separatist, am thinking strong, positive feelings
				about lesbians and lesbianism as 1 work, lesbians are
				drawn to my work. One told me she physically felt
				warm glows pass through her body when she put on a
				poncho; some have told me they feel strong with it.
				One woman referred to stripes in the shoulders of a
				poncho as “power stripes.
				Also, as a lesbian-separatist, I sometimes am thinking
			</p>
         <p>
				negative thoughts and feelings about men and some
				straight women as 1 work, and, consequently, they
				often do not even notice my display. There is no mag¬
				netic energy to attract them. Not only are they not
				attracted, but sometimes they feel repelled by my work.
				This pleases me, because I feel very strongly that I only
				want to sell to lesbians, and this way I don’t have to
				make any special effort to accomplish it.
				My partner is a jeweler, and she has noticed the same
				phenomenon. Many lesbians have told her that they
				draw strength and self-esteem from her work, not only
				from the lesbian symbol rings and pendants, but also
				from stone rings that are not specifically “lesbian." It is
				the love for herself as a lesbian, and her concern for all
				lesbians, which they are absorbing.
				Any subject, then, may be lesbian art, and lesbian
				subjects may not be lesbian art. What makes the dif¬
				ference, in my mind, is the thought and feeling about
				lesbians which the maker feels as she works, the tangible
				energy which becomes part of the product and is com¬
				municated to the consumer.

				Lesbianartist.
				I wish I had a lesbianartist button.
				Asmall black and white button with six-point Optima
				letters.
				Intimate. Women would have to read it up close.
				A button for a high-energy day.
				Clearly the word makes me happy.
				It didn’t always.
				I spent a lot of time not believing there was a connec-
				tion between my sexuality and the art 1 made, not be¬
				lieving my two carefully separated adult identities had
				been closely bound together even in childhood and, cer¬
				tainly not believing the content of my painting was
				emotional.
				Joining together two powerful words made me recog¬
				nize the focus of my life and put me in touch with my
				own work.
				If I hadn’t been a lesbian I wouldn’t be an artist.
				From girlhood I had admired strong women, loving
				their intelligence and strength.
				I focused on what was woman-identified, experienc¬
				ing a passion, not yet genital, not yet verbalized, that
				made me want to find an identity in work, in expres¬
				sion, in making paintings.
				In making art, I hadn’t before realized how closely
			</p>
         <p>
				related the content was to the impulse that made me
				want to be an artist in the first place.
				When I was eight years old I had a game.
				I would go out into a grove of trees away from the
				other children and would take pieces of bark and sticks.
				I would draw on them with nail polish and lipstick
				and crayons, writing secret things about admiration for
				women, about a crush on a woman.
				While making these I was very intent; but then I
				would get very frightened.
				The slightest sound of anyone approaching would
				make me hide them under leaves, bury them in the
				ground.
				In my work now 1 use wood and paint.
				I make marks that spell out secrets, burying them un¬
				der layers and layers of glossy color.
				The secrets, repeated dozens of times, asserted and
				recognized, then protected and hidden so well—some¬
				times I don’t see them myself.
				It’s been a long time since I was eight years old, but
				the secrets, the pain and happiness of loving women
				were then and still are the motivation and content of my
				work.

				These are the questions l am asking:
				What has your relationship been to asking questions?
				Did you ask questions in school, at home? Why were
				you asking?
				How do youfeel about asking questions now?
				How do you feel when young people ask you ques¬
				tions?
				Are there particular people you have difficulty hear¬
				ing information from or situations in which it is hard to
				hear information?
				How does it feel when people give you information
				you already have or about something you already know
				about? Is it important to you that people know that you
				know things?
				Do you remember the first time you had a new
				thought or idea, one that was totally your own? Was
				there ever a conscious awareness of such a thing?
				Have you ever had the feeling that you were the first
				one to find or discover something, the first one to make
				particular connections? Does that have anything to do
				with art-making for you?
				When did you realize you could and do affect the
				world? Was there a time of realizing your power?
				Do you remember the first time you did a public “pol¬
				itical" act?
				What is your relationship to beauty and beautiful
				things?
				When did you realize or decide you were an artist?
				Which did you do?
				How do youfeel about the idea of art being a luxury?
				Do you ever do unimportant things?
				What did your parents do when you were growing
				What was your family's attitudes towards art?
				What was your relationship to conformity or being
				different when you were growing up?
				What were you like in high school? How are you dif-
				ferent? How are you different than you thought youd
				be when you were in high school?
				Some thoughts and answers:
				Did you know that I am not really an actual artist?
				When I was in first grade I found out that I could not
				draw and I knew it then. I don’t remember the exact
				moment of realization.
				I remember that for a long time, as a little girl, my
				fantasy was that I would marry a struggling artist and
				definitely never be one. I have been feeling a connection
				between deciding to be a lesbian and taking control of
				that fantasy and throwing it out the window for good. If
				1 am never going to marry someone, or have a man be
				the “core of my existence, that fantasy can never
				become true. The struggling part of the fantasy is cer¬
				tainly out of my upper middle class background, where
				I idealized and romanticized struggling, and it is also
				part of the artist myth. Chronologically I decided to
				become an artist before I decided to become a lesbian,
				but they are and were part of the same process; of
				saying that my life is important, of valuing my life and
				my self as a woman, of beginning to let go of living for
				others and seeing myself in the eyes of others and also
				giving up that deeply ingrained and conditioned
				woman’s sense that only when 1 am giving, am 1 worth-
				while, do I deserve to live etc.
				At the time that I decided that I wasn’t an artist, I
				really decided it. I knew then that creativity and all that
				went with it was not part of me or my life. There was a
				stopping of the expression of my self, of the creating
			</p>
         <p>
				from inside of me, saying who I was and what the world
				was to me.
				I remember when I was pretty young, in Sunday
				school, doing a drawing of the Tower of Babel, which
				was hung up with other drawings and my teacher said
				that I was a good artist. She said it on my Sunday
				school report card. That is the only memory I have of
				being appreciated for art work. The next thing I
				remember is being in first grade and having our teacher
				put on music and we were supposed to draw to the
				music with our eyes closed. Everyone else in the class
				drew abstract drawings, apparently to the feeling and
				rhythm of the music. I drew a house, a tree and a walk. I
				did not get a star for my drawing and I think I was—I
				must have been—very embarrassed. 1 remember in third
				grade all of us making towels where we stitched threads
				into the towels and I was the only one who did not make
				a geometric design. I did some seagulls and an ocean
				with a boat on it.
				I knew that an artist was the one thing I would never
				be! There was something about my absolute non-identi¬
				fication with the creativity or activity of "artist" which
				had significance beyond the fact that I wasn’t calling
				myself an artist.
				I am seeing that being a lesbian means valuing my
				perceptions, as well as other women’s perceptions and
				seeing that the world is a place 1 (we) have a right to be
				in charge of. I realize my outsideness and with that
				knowledge I begin to learn and then create beyond the
				given reality, and live beyond it.
				There is a kind of question that is thought-provoking
				and "interesting" that I feel very involved in thinking
				about and asking. It has to do with some awarenesses
				that I have come to through being alive, particularly in
				the past few years. These questions stay with me and l
				love them and they feel like my “art. They are the
				results of awakening parts of me that have been shut
				down, not allowed to grow. I catch a glimmer of the me
				that really exists, fully alive, spontaneous, responsible,
				creative, awake and aware and active and unafraid. The
				feeling of a "first time” or a "new discovery” has to do
				with breaking through from that old space of hurt and
				shut down to the way 1 can be, the way every person
				can be, all the time.
				There is something very important to me about
				saying that I am a lesbian, that I am a feminist, that I am
				an artist, that 1 am a Jew, that 1 am a woman, that 1 am
				from an upper middle class family, that I am white, etc.
				It has to do with owning parts of me, with feeling them,
				with being public, with all of me out, not ashamed of
				anything that 1 am. In that way it feels very active to say
				lam.

				Being and growing up lesbian always put me out of
				sync with my peers. I never did understand certain
				phenomena of our times. Do you remember screaming
				at your first Elvis Presley movie? Mine was Love Me
				Tender. I saw a whole generation of women screaming
				at the images and evocations of male sexual provoca¬
				tion. I sat in the audience wondering what it was that
				these women were feeling. I didn’t feel like screaming. I
				thought it was strange the way my friends were
				behaving, but always I felt the undercurrent that I was
				the one that was wrong.
				We have been brought up to respond to certain cul¬
				turally defined stimulations. I didn’t respond. I went
				through school unaffected by the captain of the football,
				basketball, soccer, wrestling, and chess teams. Without
				these things there was little else. My friendships with
				women were steady but painful, when one by one they
				had their first crush with the new boy in town. They
				moved, talked and pleased one huge romantic ideal¬
				falling in love and marriage. Sex was already there;
				their tease and their rape. Living in rural Lake Hopat-
				cong, New Jersey, didn’t provide any alternative life¬
				style, not in the fifties.
				When I came out as a lesbian it was wonderful. A
				whole life began to take shape. Coming out was a joyous
				time. Suddenly ice blood dissolved, walls became win¬
				dows and doors. But making a new lifestyle is a slow
				and steady process. It took years to wear away at the
				circles of isolation, fear and repression. I wanted the
				knowledge I felt had been hidden from me. The gay and
				women’s movements provided support and information.
				With a growing perspective, doing my art work became
				really important and possible. Now there is so much I
				feel I want to do. Part of that is I want to leave records.
				Growing into womanhood 1 am finding my ancestors
				and making herstory. Our contact creates fibers and
				pathways for others.

				In the deepest sense of the word, 1 see lesbian humor
				as the essence of the playful spirit, but play in the most
				challenging-to-the-cosmos sense. We play with our
				imagination, with our sexual freedoms, with our clothes
				-costuming not to represent power parodies like leath¬
				er, but to laugh at the confines of color and texture,
				lines—and in our playing we create new worlds because
				of the deepest sense of the deadliness of this one. Les
				Guerilleres is playing at its most powerful, creation of
				language, names, structures, with joyous energy and
				warrior strength. I know this sounds philosophical, and
				yet even when 1 was an old femme 1 knew there was an
				amazon world—not by reading or talking but by the
				strength and adventure I felt in entering the bars,
				walking the street late at night, stepping out of bounds
				even if it was to find a closeness that was defined by
				who did what. The important thing was we did, and we
				laughed in the faces of the Mafia men. Our play with
				language seems to come from the same impulse—to turn
				around the givens, to reinforce each other’s daring and
				strength in playing above this world. I think our humor,
				like many other parts of our culture, is celebration—the
				cheering on of each other to make a new universe in the
				presence of each other, to drop the sticks of this world
				at each other’s feet and pick up the pieces all mixed up
				and in so doing assert our ability to create new worlds. I
				think our writers have mostly known this: they played
				with sentence structure and threw their words up into
				the air, their air, to make them fall into a different way
				of symbolizing a different life. I think we play because
				this world is not ours, and we are self-cherishing enough
				to know we must live somewhere. We are connected to
				each other enough to believe we have the power to
				create new worlds at this very moment with the words
				we play with.

				Lesbian is who I am; feminist is how I think. Femin-
				ism gave me vision, self-love, and love for other
				women, not the other way around. 1 know women who
				love women and are not lesbians. I know lesbians who
				are haters of self and other women (no surprise: men
				hate us and fuck us). Nevertheless, for me coming out as
				a lesbian was continuous with my development as a
				feminist. I can’t talk about myself as "lesbian artist
				apart from "feminist artist"; nor do I want to.
				The year I came out was the year in which I began
				writing again, after a nine year silence. I now under¬
				stand that breakthrough partly as an explosion through
				fear—fear that inside me was a self, a vision, that would
				either horrify men or bore them. My friend Paula King
				says, "Being a lesbian meant 1 could create what
				wanted." Yes. It meant I stopped caring about male
				boredom, shock, or disgust. It meant—and means—that
				women are at the center of my eye, that I think of
				women’s ears when 1 write, that my work grows
				through the tug and shove of female response to it.
				But it was not just coming out which allowed me to
				write. It was also the conscious creation/discovery of a
				tradition of female art, a sense of connection with other
				creators, past and present, a connection which provides
				support, validation of one’s technique and subject mat¬
				ter, and a source for imagery, ideas, and forms. This is a
				circulatory system which makes me know we are one
				body; the network is literally vital.
				A friend tells me she read Lessing's Golden Notebook
				in the early sixties and found it “boring," i.e., threaten¬
				ing; the air of that time clogged her ears with self-hate.
				When I read the same book in 1970, I was electrified.
				From my journal, 1970, after reading the GN: “With
				Anna pouring jug after jug of warm water over her
				stale-smelling menstruating cunt, you'd think she'd tell
				us what kind of birth control she uses. Does she never
				worry about being pregnant?” Never mind the body-
				hating words I chose in 1970. Lessing's matter-of-fact
				treatment of menstruation instantly upped my expecta¬
				tions so that I was annoyed by her omission of another
				facet of my bodily experience. Prior to the GN, prior to
				the feminist movement, it had never occurred to me to
				miss myself in all those books I plowed through. We are
				seeing in this last decade a gathering of demands on
				artists to tell the truth about female experience. We
				write in a context of an audience which requires respon¬
				sible work from its artists, an audience responsive in
				turn to our subject matter and technique.
				I want to tell the truth as best I can, to recycle the
				energy 1 have gotten from women’s creative work, to
				get that energy back in the form of more and more
				women articulating their experience. We all have stories
				and they should be told—mine among them. Thus we
				come to understand our experience through naming it.
				Thus we nourish each other, feed our visionary selves¬
				the selves who know change is possible. My medium is
				words. It is what I know. I feel its limits. I would rather
				make movies. I would rather take over TV. I would
				most rather overthrow the government. But words are
				what 1 can use.
				Much of my writing falls into the category “lesbian
				art" because 1 am a lesbian; the content is my experi¬
				ence, much of it common to all women. Fear of rape,
				job discrimination, survival anxiety, female solidarity,
				the whole societal weight of sexism, some struggles with
				men, participation in raising two boy children, watch¬
			</p>
         <p>
				ing them start to swagger, wondering how to love them
				as they turn into little piggies. My past is heterosexual,
				different from that of lesbians who have always been
				aware of their love for women, who were never touched
				or wounded deeply by men. 1 want to explore, and want
				other lesbians to explore, these differences among us.
				Gay chauvinism: I have practiced it, been victimized by
				it. Now I see it as only destructive, as one more hier¬
				archy (how long have you been out? 1 came out in the
				crib....)
				Since I began writing as a lesbian, much of my past
				remains unwritten: what has happened to women, how
				my life was formed, how it served men, how it did not
				serve me, how it was made to seem inevitable. What
				transpired in my marriage bed, for example, was pre¬
				dictable, anything but natural. It had as little to do with
				love or pleasure or sexuality as the grocery list. It had
				more to do with the grocery list.
				Also important in my past: familial relationships
				among women, my grandmothers, mother, aunts.
				need to see these more clearly, with less anger, less fear
				of being trapped as they were trapped, with more love. I
				have not yet written about the deep bond between
				myself and my sister, a positive model for the relation¬
				ships I build with women.
				I assume the telling of my specifically lesbian experi¬
				ences is useful since I find myself so hungry for details of
				other lesbians' relationships. We all need practice in
				seeing what is happening and in telling the truth. In how
				to love each other better than we were taught. How it is
				hard to face a formless, unfolding future. We used to
				chant these words like a litany, double axes gleaming in
				our eyes. Now I am more aware of difficulties alongside
				the palpable joy. I want to be honest about these diffi¬
				culties.
				Yet I find myself hopeful. If sexuality is one of the
				earliest deepest emotional constructs to be institutional¬
				ized in our tiny child-bodies, and if at age twenty-six I
				could discover a range of sexual feelings—a whole capa¬
				city previously invisible—I can only conclude that all
				change is possible, and that we don’t yet know a
				fraction of our capabilities. So I feel great optimism
				about personal transformation within severe limits. I
				feel less optimistic just at present about breaking
				through the limits, i.e., transforming the world. I feel
				despair/comfort when I think how my opportunity for
				growth is stifled by patriarchy/capitalism—despair
				because I will never get to be my fullest possible self;
				comfort because 1 can at least understand the reasons
				for my blocks, fears, tightness. I see danger in demand¬
				ing that we live the revolution before the revolution.
				The relationship between consciousness, action, and
				material reality is crucial. I have been working on some
				notes—still formless—about competitive feelings among
				women; not competition for men, but feelings of envy
				and threat among lovers and friends. I see these feelings
				partly as a realistic response to a world whose goods
				need not be scarce, but are (jobs, publishers, even love
				and respect): partly as an archaic response to an old and
				perilous lesson about competition. I have felt much guilt
				about my feelings of competitiveness, a guilt which
				keeps me from feeling them, thus from working through
				them. I want to write about the masking feelings-
				feelings we feel instead of feeling something else: guilt;
				embarrassment; boredom; laziness; even desire. I want
				to rename my feelings more accurately, to disrupt the
			</p>

         <p>
				categories within which I learned to know myself. To
				recognize the weight of the past so 1 can more readily
				put down what is burdensome, hug what is useful. To
				acknowledge my luck in living through a time when the
				feminist movement is making my life joyful and my
				work possible; to acknowledge my dependence on our
				movement's continued movement.
				Finally, I want to learn not to say what comes easiest,
				since for me “easy” often means old." This last comes
				from my experience of being challenged by my lover,
				another poet, about the ending of a poem: “Do you
				really feel as helpless as that?” she asked, and I had to
				confess that I didn’t, and I rewrote the poem. Here is the
				rewritten poem. It is the most logical conclusion.

				LIVING WITH CHAOS
				This morning the NY Times said
				the airforce is building new bombers.
				On points like this
				the Times is to be trusted.
				Tomatoes rot in the garden,
				your children play tag on the roof.
				I picture small bodies tripping, plummeting,
				squashing tomatoes to a fine red ooze,
				bones poking through flesh.
				I tell them to stop, they laugh.
				Helplessness swells in me like a bomb:
				they will stop when they’re ready.
				This is not my house but I want to clean it.
				I want to sponge down the table, pick up dustcrumbs,
				put the tomatoes up in jars.
				I want to wrap the children in blankets,
				feed them soup.
				I want to scrub the air transparent
				take away the bombs, wash the children,
				put us to bed.
				Helplessness rises in me like bread,
				bread to feed no one.
				This morning I went looking for patterns,
				could find no order, no repetition.
				Then realized, this was the pattern:
				everything from scratch.
				If things would hold still long enough to be named,
				we could have more lucid conversations,
				before a fire, over good wine.
				Instead we make do with the pale whistle of hunger, fear,
				the quick rush of desire.

				I am writing as a lesbian feminist artist in the Minne¬
				sota Arts Community. This is difficult because there are
				few substantial conversations about the personal and
				political implications of lesbian art here, and those few
				conversations that do exist result from an atmosphere of
				paranoia.
				There are two specific instances of the art world in the
				Twin Cities politically using the label “lesbian” to exert
				community control over women’s groups. The first was
				the termination after one year of the Women’s Arts Core
				Program at the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul. The
				program instilled great fear and was discussed and des¬
				scribed by those not participating as a lesbian program
				that used harmful brainwashing techniques. As a result
				the students in the program were questioned about les¬
				bianism and in certain instances verbally pressured to
				give information concerning the number of lesbians in
				the program, who they were, and who they were sleep-
				ing with.
				The women in the program were asked to submit re¬
				ports on their area of academic study, fill out program
				evaluations, and participate in hour long tape-recorded
				individual interviews. All of these demands were met
				and the participating women themselves felt the pro¬
				gram was highly successful. However, the paranoia,
				hostility and inherent homophobia induced a full facul¬

				ty meeting to vote for a moratorium until further studies
				could be completed. That was five months ago
				The political use of the lesbian label to attack fem¬
				inists and their art worked once and it may work again.
				Similar tactics of divide and conquer are being aimed at
				the W.A.R.M. Gallery, a women’s co-operative art gal-
				lery in Minneapolis. Because it is a women’s gallery with
				an all-woman membership and exhibition policy, the
				community has labeled it as a lesbian organization, al¬
				though in reality the gallery includes and shows both
				straight and gay women. Sexual preference has not been
				a criterion. However, outside homophobia is manip¬
				ulating internal homophobia, by using “lesbian” as a
				negative and dangerous image. Gallery members have
				been told that people are afraid to come into the gallery
				because they would be confronted by radical lesbians
				and that W.A.R.M. has a dyke image.
				In reaction to this some of the women in the gallery
				feel compelled to exhibit male artists and have submit¬
				ted exhibition proposals which read like this:
				Invitational for Men—Each gallery member would choose
				one male artist who they feel has been supportive of women to
				be included in the show. I feel this would be good P.R. for the
				gallery in the arts community and a good way to get publicity
				as well as being an encouragement for men to be supportive of

				"Let’s invite a man to have a show.
				Women feel comfortable in dealing with the lesbian
				issue without the protective environment of an all¬
				woman organization but remain concerned about the
				external public image. In their attempt to dispel the les
				bian image, they want to integrate men in some way.
				The assumption is that male reads “heterosexual” and
				female reads “lesbian." This situation allows the estab¬
				lished community structure to have a foothold on the
				internal workings of the feminist structure with women
				spending the majority of their time and energy taking
				care of the general community (men) rather than them¬
				selves and their work. Of course this is one purpose of
				patriarchal politics.
				If the above mentioned questions were changed from
				dispelling the lesbian image to dispelling the discrimina¬
				tory practices that are associated with the label “les¬
				bian, then the community would need to be directly
				confronted and held accountable for its own discrimina¬
				tory practices whether based on sexual preference or
				bias toward all-woman structures.
				The politics surrounding homophobia is reminiscent
				of McCarthyism or the power which is generated from
				the manipulation of fear. Consciously/unconsciously
				choosing to be manipulated by internalized fear makes
				every individual a vulnerable target. Taking a passive
				or non-confronting posture allows the existing homo¬
				phobic structure to remain intact. Political maneuvers
				of this kind have separated gay and straight women,
				working class and middle class women, and white and
				Third World women. It has driven wedges into the
				power base of woman-developed structures, separated
				us from our goals, and dispersed our creative energy.

				movement is too worried about gaining approval from
				the male left and is too afraid to be associated with
				lesbian feminism and so is not capable of developing a
				true women’s culture—which is what 1 am into.
				A real women’s culture can only be developed by
				women together, women who have withdrawn their
				sexual, creative, and emotional power from men.
				Women who ultimately seek male approval, because
				they are sexually dependent on men, will never
				ultimately be able to draw any real consequences of
				their own actions, feelings, and thoughts. They will
				always be somehow looking sideways. So the real out-
				rageous and unafraid statements have come from
				lesbian women. (I am very aware when I say this that at
				this point in time a great deal of women’s sexual depen¬
				dence” on men is simply based on economics (women's
				poverty and fear of losing their children), and that the
				majority of women have no choice in the matter of
				whether or not to live with a man.

				paintings of women, they seemed perfectly obvious and
				at the same time had a look about them of something
				not being quite right to many who saw them for the first
				time. So unused are we (women &amp; men) to seeing
				women portrayed with strength by a woman. My
				paintings were accused of being “ugly," meaning the
				women are not pleasing to men.
				It is when you as an artist portray women with love
				and pride—and not just complain about women's
				situation and repressed lives—that the abuse is thrown
				at you. Male critics, who actually call themselves left¬
				wing and radical, have said about my work that “they
				feel alienated from my view on women and my views on
				sisterhood and motherhood." I am accused of being a
				mystic. Some of my paintings are based on what 1 have
				understood of matriarchal societies—where the religion
				was centered around the Great Mother and women were
				the main producers, the first farmers, and owned the
				land. One of my paintings shows symbolically the uni¬
				versal creative power as a woman giving birth in space
				(God Giving Birth"). But that is only one of my
				paintings; others are of women working, struggling,
				relating to each other. According to the Swedish critics I
				should keep only to the kitchen sink or talk about my
				pain at being born a woman in a man’s world. Appar¬
				ently you shouldn’t presume as a woman that you
				should or could make any flights into thoughts about
				creative energy, religious beliefs, the cosmos, or
				women’s identity in relation to herself and other
				women.

				For some time 1 have recognized that my sculpture
				reflects aspects of my personal experience. Nevertheless
				I had not been able to effectively distinguish the person¬
				al lesbian content of the work from the broader female
				imagery. Recently, however, I realized I had been inter
				preting the work in terms of female anatomy and geni¬
				talia, but not in terms of how I experience those forms.
				The unity, strength and openness, the materials and the
				arrangement of forms that I see in my work closely con¬
				nect with the expansion of self into nature which I feel
				during orgasmic contact with a woman. The biological
				parts of my work are common to all women; the sexual
				experience, as a whole, is lesbian. I would like to share
				two of my sculpted images which express the spiritual/
				sexual nature of that experience.
				"Omphale" is a large, open bowl that is a visual
				expression of the orgasmic experience. The vessel has
				always been a symbol of change, from simple cooking
				conversion to alchemical transformation. The activity
				of “Omphale” creates feelings of change from moving
				into, through, and out into the landscape. To indicate
				the transformation the image is carved from "fungal
				elm wood striated with earth-like patterns of decay. The
				dilated protuberances curving around the bowl are felt
				sequentially in the act of swelling. The swollen forms
				actually radiate out into the landscape while the wide
				spout of the bowl tips toward the earth.
			</p>
         <p>
				The biological forms in “Autoerotic Bowl" are simply
				five fingers poised at the vaginal opening. The bowl
				knot which still retains the natural rough bark is made
				of oak. From the exterior body of the bowl’s surface the
				fingers curve inwardly around the lip. The movement
				from the erotic act itself to the natural landscape is obvi¬
				ous: the bottomless bowl opens into the earth.
				Embodied in the work is a sense of the personal, his¬
				toric and mythic. My readings on mythologies and
				ancient cultures clearly have expanded my understand¬
				ing of my imagery. 1 am intrigued by the resemblance of
				Autoerotic Bowl" to the basic structure of the rhyton,
				which was a ceremonial vessel with holes in both ends,
				used in Minoan culture. It is significant that the liba¬
				tion liquid to effect change had to pass through the
				vessel/female symbol and then onto object or earth.
				With some sculpted pieces 1 make direct connections to
				the past by naming them after women in history.
				Omphale" was the name of a Lydian Amazon queen.
				Moreover, in Greek the word "omphalos" means the
				center, middle or more beautifully that part of the rose
				where the seed forms are created. As in early civiliza¬
				tions and current primitive cultures, 1 feel that sculpted
				images should be used in ceremony.

				"Lesbian writers can’t be taken seriously. They’re
				limited. Narrow, kinky, twisted. Incapable of univer¬
				sality. Lesbian writing is not, certainly, for the mass
				market, for decent people’s homes. Let them have their
				little presses, their little distributorship and galleries.
				They make up a special interest group, like your bird
				watchers, your genealogists. So the male-identified
				critics say.
				My great-grandfather refused to allow my great-
				grandmother to buy paper, for fear she would “waste
				her time writing. Confined to do stitchery, she embroid¬
				ered lines of her poetry on the inner hems of her
				daughter’s dresses. She was a lesbian writer, though she
				would not have called herself either lesbian or writer.
				We lesbian writers are formidable, threatening, to the
				breastless controllers of power and money. They, too,
				are formidable. This struggle informs and enriches our
				art, and will not lie silent, will not be locked away. Les¬
				bian writers have married men and kept house and
				borne children and cooked and cleaned their lives away
				scribbling in journals, writing letters to each other,
				shaping poems they kept hidden under mattresses or in
				sewing baskets. Lesbian writers have painted plates,
				arranged flowers, decorated birthday cakes and com¬
				mitted suicide. I know my kind, how it has been for us,
				and how long.
				As a lesbian writer, 1 report how it has been, what our
				options were, and what we chose. 1 tell our stories, the
				grimness and the love. I tell breast, hair, blood, the
				undulant curve and the clitoral vibration. I tell the
				touch and the womantalk which flows between us. I am
				speaking quietly, as calmly as l once spoke in recipes, of
				the power of the mother-will and of revolution.
				I have learned, in my confinement, skills which serve
				me well. I write as steadily as I once ironed men’s shirts,
				write as vigilantly as I watched over my toddlers and
				listened for their coughs in the night. I write as only
				women can, as only women have: with interruptions,
				and with love and without cease. My images are female,
				my symbols are female, my energy is female. Lesbian.

				All the dangers of being a woman under patriarchy
				intensify as my visibility in the dominant culture
				increases, especially since it increases by more than one
				count: as writer, feminist, lesbian, foreigner. Some of
				the dangers: trivialization, stereotyping (since much of
				my work is sensual and lyric I dread the possibility of
				being dubbed “erotic" and being limited to that label),
				isolation through the star-systems and image-making
				verbal and physical harassment, assault, threats. And
				co-optation. Of all these the fear of co-optation, of
				losing touch with myself, my sisters, what is necessary
				and real for us, this fear has never left me since I received.
				the Yale (Younger Poets) Award.
				Then again, visibility makes possible much greater
				contact with women. What enabled me to begin writing
				with authenticity was my decision, in 1973, to speak
				only to a female and feminist audience. It gave me a
				sense of community, a sense of connection and responsi¬
				bility, a necessity beyond the personal pleasure of
				writing. It gave me stamina and sustained me. I no
				longer had to explain so I began to sing. This is a gift
				women have given me, a gift 1 want to share with as
			</p>
         <p>
				many as possible. And so I am grateful for the award,
				the visibility, which widens the circles of women I can
				get to know
				Visibility also gives me permission to speak in public,
				or gives me certain kinds of authority, such as judging
				competitions. l’m still trying to come to terms with this,
				since 1 fear that it is through this door that co-optation
				most easily enters, but right now feel that if I can main¬
				tain my connection and responsibility to my women's
				community 1 can use these occasions to say or demon¬
				strate things that the patriarchy would rather keep
				unmentioned.
				On the most immediate level, in my work, I am trying
				to write poems that are free of the institutionalized con¬
				flicts and brutality that have characterized our literary
				tradition for so long, to use simple grammar and syntax,
				and to praise, praise.

				Before talking about what it means to me to be a les¬
				bian artist, 1 want to emphasize two other distinguishing
				things about myself: (1) I am a West Coast person, hav¬
				ing lived in San Francisco for the last fifteen years
				(though I grew up in the Midwest). We live differently
				out here from people on the East Coast or in the middle
				of the country. We are in a different relation to our
				lives, our bodies, our work and “careers. (2) I am not
				attached to any academic institution, nor have 1 ever
				been since 1 was a student.
				The term artist is hard for me to use, given its con¬
				notations of privilege, elitism and irresponsibility. The
				mystique surrounding that term is damaging to us as
				women, I think, and as makers of things. Maybe l’II just
				call myself a writer, for the purposes of this discussion.
				Now: being a lesbian writer. I think of myself as an
				outlaw. I operate outside the heterosexist establishment,
				and my effort is to subvert it so that some more humane
				system can be established. Women are primary to me.
				Having worked for a year in New York as a guest
				editor at Mademoiselle and having for years followed
				with passionate interest the goings-on in the so-called
				literary world, I think I know what it’s about. (I speak
				of the world of the New York Review of Books and its
				little brothers.) And the conclusion I have come to is
				that this world subsists on and purveys a very high level
				of bullshit which is, at worst, destructive to women, and
				at best, a waste of time for us.
				I feel myself to be part of a world of print created by
				the independent women’s newspapers, journals and pub¬
				lishers such as the Women’s Press Collective, Daughters,
				Inc., Diana Press, etc. All of us together are creating
				something new, in that we are bringing into literature a
				consciousness that has never been expressed before.
				The task for me is to get to what I know and then
				express it in the clearest way possible (I do not mean to
				say that one function precedes the other; they are at
				best simultaneous.). When I say that I want my writing
				to be accessible to everyone, I do not mean that I wish
				to write conventional novels in the style of the nine¬
				teenth century, which is still the formula for pulp fic¬
				tion. But I am concerned with content, as I think all
				genuine feminist writers are. We want to examine the
				experience of women and articulate the hard questions
				posed by the struggle of the last few years. And for me,
			</p>
         <pb n="51"/>
         <p>
				prose is not performance, but ideally a clear glass
				through which the reader enters the story. The medium
				should disappear.
				Part of the revolutionary content of our work, I be¬
				lieve, is the re-experiencing of our bodies. Having been
				brought up in a repressed and ignorant condition for the
				purposes of capitalism and heterosexism, our resistance
				to knowledge of our bodies is extreme. We are trauma¬
				tized, we freeze, we become blind and deaf in the pres
				ence of flesh. A book that confronts us with flesh is
				Monique Wittig’s The Lesbian Body. And because we
				resist so strongly, Wittig has to proceed in a violent
				manner. She has to take us by the back of the head and
				shove our face into it to make us look at the body,
				touch, smell, taste it from the inside, make us stare at it
				rotten and putrid and every possible way it can be—so
				that we will come to know and accept and love our own
				flesh.
				Part of what I love about dykes is our toughness.
				And that toughness can be connected up with a deep
				awareness of women too; lesbians are mothers and les¬
				bians are daughters, so we have the whole range of
				women’s experience and the other dimension too, which
				is the unique viewpoint of the dyke. This extra dimen¬
				sion puts us a step outside of so-called normal life and
				lets us see how gruesomely abnormal it is, lets us see the
				kinds of illusions that people live by, that steal people’s
				lives from them. It puts us up against the moment,
				against the reality of creating our own lives and rela¬
				tionships because there are few models. But this examin¬
				ing and inventing reaches out beyond our individual
				lives and relationships into a way of viewing what goes
				on around us, and can issue in a world-view that is dis¬
				tinct in history and uniquely liberating. It is our con¬
				tinued working together over time, taking risks, remain¬
				ing true to ourselves and stretching ourselves out be
				yond our limits, that will lead us to the development of
				this world-view.
				What I want to do in my own work is to affirm wom-
				en’s strength, and I don’t mean by that to pretend to a
				kind of strength that isn’t real. (For instance, I find hero¬
				ines like Wonder Woman or Super Dyke offensive.) In
				the novel l’ve been writing, the character who started
				out at the most disadvantage, supposedly, was one of
				the women who was very aware of her own anguish,
				who experienced herself in pain and out of joint with
				other people and the world. Over time, she is the charac-
				ter who developed the most strength. The other women
				in the book, who initially were more appealing, did not
				grow as much. It surprised me during the writing of the
				book, to see this woman, the most ineffectual and hurt¬
				ing one, develop into the most complete and effectual
				human being there. I didn’t intend for this to happen;
				she just grew naturally within the events and feelings
				and interactions of the novel. And looking back, I think
				her depth came from her being so connected to, so
				aware of, her pain. So when I present images of wom¬
				en’s strength, 1 want that to come out of a true under¬
				standing of the difficulties of our lives and the agonies
				one has to endure in the midst of our struggles and vic¬
				tories. To tell the truth is not easy. I hope I have the
				wisdom and courage and skill to do it.

				In my personal life the power of the combination les¬
				bian/feminist/artist is tremendous. By personal life 1
				mean the life I lead in my studio, where 1 take measure
				ments of myself and begin to invent hypotheses and
				possibilities based on these measurements. One way in
				which the power of lesbian/feminist/artist has mani¬
				fested itself is in the terror that I uncover through
				painting. Sometimes I need a couple of hours to
				"recover” after a painting. I can feel very tangibly as
				though with a painting my head has split open and
				something has been birthed from that chasm. The terror
				is (again, tangibly) the feeling that my head needs to
				close up before I can interact with the world directly,
				lest something unwanted and terrible from the world get
				in through that split. I always have this feeling after
				painting something that comes from my gut, something
				that, no matter how indecipherable to anyone, has
				come from an automatic gesture from within me. 1 can
				recognize it as such.
				Two things I have learned from lesbian-feminism are
				that: a) irrational terrors are possibly not irrational at
				all but part of a terrorizing way of life that goes on for
				all women, and b) the terror often increases for women
				who take steps away from compliance with the system.
				Terror of rape, terror of being molested, of being tor¬
				tured, of being taken over, of intrusion. I link all these
				together for myself and for other feminist lesbians. They
				are real. We’re not irrational. Even the protective ges¬
				tures that 1 make in my studio to avoid the very pos-
				sibility of intrusion are linked to my fear of coming
				apart, being taken apart.

				Because of my saturation in sociology, I believe that
				all theories should be put to the test of research. In my
				opinion, the question of a common denominator
				existing between women artists, other than gender, is
				still on the drafting table, is still a theory unproven.
				Without defining it, it is dangerously refutable. Without
				defining women s art, it is impossible to secondly reach
				conclusions about lesbian art. As long as there remains
				essentially no data, as long as art remains what the indi¬
				vidual concedes it to be, general terms such as lesbian
				art will always be uncomfortable terms lesbians believe
				to be true without knowing how to define what they
				mean. In other words, "I know l’m a lesbian artist but I
				don’t know what that means. Sure, 1 could come up
				with something, but I believe a political statement merits
				more research than what I, or several other lesbians,
				could individually come up with.
				As far as the Sweaty Palms show (in Chicago), where
				four of us advertised our work as being produced by
				four lesbian artists, 1 can only speak retrospectively and
				for myself. The show proved that one can not stereotype
				lesbians and the art they produce; one could not find
